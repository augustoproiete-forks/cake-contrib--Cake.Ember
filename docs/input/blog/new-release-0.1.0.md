# First Release Completed

Very happy to announce the initial release of the Cake.Ember addin for [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/).

This initial release shipped with two main features:

* Ember Build
* Ember Serve

While there are many other commands that the Ember CLI can run, not all of them make sense in the context of a build system, therefore these will only be implemented on an as required basis.

Please do not hesitate to reach out in the [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/cake-contrib/Lobby) if you have any issues using this addin.
